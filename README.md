# Sssssnake-It-Till-You-Make-It
## Inspiration
_Sssssnake It Till You Make_ It is all about coziness, connection, and community as we learn to navigate a world laden with AI. 

Our game encourages users to be uniquely themselves in a world of machines! We were inspired by people’s need for connection and emotion, and wanted to represent it in a simple and fun way through a snake dress up game! We wanted to make a game people could come to whenever they feel down and need something fun to escape to; their snake friend will always be there waiting to welcome them back!

Another major inspiration was ourselves and our friend group! The game is littered with tons of inside jokes and references to us.

## What it does
Our game allows its users to escape the stress and struggles of real life to go relax in their snake friend’s cozy room, spending time together and growing their friendship. Together users can read stories, dress up their snake, listen to music, and explore their surroundings. As the game progresses, the room and snake will evolve to better reflect the user, their snake friend, and their friendship!

## How we built it
_Sssssnake It Till You Make It_ was built in C# in Unity. We used a combination of hand drawn assets, digitally made graphics, and free assets available on the Unity Assets Store. The whole process started with brainstorming ideas and fleshing out the game’s design. Afterwards, we spent a lot of time setting up Unity to allow us to work collaboratively, while also beginning to design the key assets such as the snake and its accessories. Once everything was set up, we coded the rest of the project, added finishing touches, and created the demonstration video.

## Challenges we ran into
Unity was a new software/game engine for about half of our team. We ran into difficulties setting up a collaborative project and spent most of the first day trying to set up our environment and share changes properly. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of the aspects we are most proud of is all the little details scattered throughout the game that show real humans made every bit of it. Every short “snake story” and accessory you can put on your snake was made by one of us. This is even further emphasized by the drawings being drawn on paper and then scanned in digitally. 

This project is undeniably us, inspired by inside jokes and shared memories within our friend group! 

## What we learned
This project taught us a lot about trial and error, troubleshooting, and adapting when things don’t go as planned. Even though we greatly struggled to get our project set up for all team members initially, we stayed motivated and put our heads together to create something that we can be proud of and truly represents our chaotic, quirky, and all-over-the-place friend group.

## What's next for Sssssnake It Till You Make It
Since _Sssssnake It Till You Make It_ is largely based on the concept of clicking items around the snake’s room and completing various activities to gain affection, we would love to add even more activities such as scrapbooking, chatting with friends, and various small minigames to play with your snake. In addition, the closet of snake accessories would be ever-expanding!
